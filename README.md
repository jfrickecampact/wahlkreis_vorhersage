Due to privacy concerns the candidate data needed to reproduce the analyses is not included in this repository. This data can be obtained for research purposes from the [Bundeswahlleiter](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/info/kontakt.html). The required structure of the data sets can be found in the `raw-data/btw<xxxx>bewerb_clean.csv` files, where <xxxx> stands for the election year. Pre-processing code for the files is included in `scripts/02-data-preprocessing.R`.
